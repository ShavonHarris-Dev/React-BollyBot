A simple random movie generator that was born from my own love of Bollywood movies. There are 50 bollywood movies coming out every moment and it takes forever to choose an appropriate one to watch. Enter BollyBot! ( The colors are a shoutout to the Hindustani flag)

## Optimizations
If I had time I would redo the UI with React, make this a backend app, and have the data in MongoDB. Right now the data is hardcoded.

## Lessons Learned:

This would be more efficient working with a database.
